					<strong>Venues :</strong> A venue would utilize our site for two main reasons. First off, the feed makes
					it easy for them to advertise concerts and events coming up. Secondly we provide a platform for venues to
					find artists to fill empty slots or find new talent to perform.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Artists :</strong> As an artist, It is imperative that you promote yourself. Our site will
					provide an outlet for just that. As more updates come to GigHub, artists will soon be able to make posts
					on the feed and even message venues and fans. Artists would use our site to jockey for gigs and promote
					shows they already have booked.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fans :</strong> As of right now a fan is mostly a spectator. It is a place you can log on to to
					see what is going on in an area. Functionality includes the ability to search venues by City, Zip, and
					even Address. When messaging goes live GigHub will turn into a social community.
