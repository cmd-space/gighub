				<p>I'm Brandon, one of the founders of GigHub, Me and my friend Kyle created the idea about a year ago but didn't have any way to actually make it come to life. I've worked in sales and customer service, and am now a Junior Web Developer. On the side I like to dirtbike, skate, and write. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the GigHub Boys.

				<p>My name’s Dante. I’ve always been interested in the music scene. Whether its organizing an event, playing a show, or just attending a concert. I love it. I’ve worked as a promoter and sound engineer for most of my adult life. Working on GigHub has been a blast. During the project I got to merge two of my favorite things: Music and Technology. Although in its current state it is small, I believe GigHub holds the potential to become a staple in the music industry for fans, promoters, venues, and artists alike.

				<p>Before I became part of the GigHub Crew, I had very little experience in coding. My first project was creating a calculator using Xcode. After completing a small project, I wanted to learn more about backend and frontend coding. Deep Dive Coding was introduced to me by an alumni of COHORT 14. During my time in this Boot-camp, I have become motivated to become fluent in Php, HTML, Bootstrap languages and also excited to learn many new programming languages. I not only want to continue developing GigHub, but I am going to use my skills the skills that I learn to take the project to new heights.

				<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project with Joe, Dante and Brandon. It's been an incredible learning experience.<a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu">Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp</a> has really allowed me the time and experiences to realize that I enjoy teaching and helping others. This project is a way for us to help fans, venues and artists collaborate with one another and forge new connections and relationships. I'm looking forward to continue working on GigHub to make this site even more useful.</p>
