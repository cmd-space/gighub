					<strong>Venues :</strong> A venue would want to utilize our site for two main reasons. First off, the
					feed makes it easy for them to advertise concerts and events coming up at their space. Secondly, we
					provide a platform for venues to find artists to fill empty slots, or find new talent to perform.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>Artists :</strong> As an artist, It is imperative that you promote yourself. Our site will
					provide an outlet for just that. As more updates come to GigHub, artists will soon be able to make posts
					on the feed and even message venues and fans. Artists would use our site to jockey for gigs, promote
					shows they already have booked, and advertise their music to fans via a SoundCloud link on their profile.
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>Fans :</strong> As of right now, a fan is a spectator. They can log on and view a feed displaying
					all the gigs logged into the database. When messaging goes live, GigHub will evolve into a social
					community.
